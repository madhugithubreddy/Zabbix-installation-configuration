First, we are going to configure the system to use the correct date and time using NTP.
How to configure Zabbix Linux Agent with SNMP protocol?

$sudo -s
#cd 
root@ip-172-31-11-222:~#


On the Linux console, use the following commands to set the correct timezone.
# dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

----ASIA----
            ||
			 -------KOLKATA--
			 
Install the Ntpdate package and set the correct date and time immediately.

# apt-get update
# apt-get install ntpdate
# ntpdate pool.ntp.br

The Ntpdate command was used to set the correct date and time using the server: pool.ntp.br

Let's install the NTP service.

# apt-get install ntp

NTP is the service that will keep our server updated.

Use the command date to check the date and time configured on your Ubuntu Linux.

# date

-------------------------If the system shown the correct date and time, this means that you followed all the steps correctly.------------------

PART1--	How to install and configure snmp agent?

SNMP Manager Server
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install snmp snmp-mibs-downloader

SNMP Agent Server
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install snmpd

Configuring the SNMP Manager Server
$ vi /etc/snmp/snmp.conf

In this file, there are a few comments and a single un-commented line. To allow the manager to import the MIB files, comment out the mibs : line:

/etc/snmp/snmp.conf
# As the snmp packages come without MIB files due to license reasons, loading
# of MIBs is disabled by default. If you added the MIBs you can reenable
# loading them by commenting out the following line.
#mibs :

example---
vi /etc/snmp/snmp.conf
##########################################################################
#/etc/snmp/snmp.conf
# As the snmp packages come without MIB files due to license reasons, loading
# of MIBs is disabled by default. If you added the MIBs you can reenable
# loading them by commenting out the following line.#
mibs :

# If you want to globally change where snmp libraries, commands and daemons
# look for MIBS, change the line below. Note you can set this for individual
# tools with the -M option or MIBDIRS environment variable.
#
# mibdirs /usr/share/snmp/mibs:/usr/share/snmp/mibs/iana:/usr/share/snmp/mibs/ietf


Save and close snmp.conf by pressing CTRL+X, followed by Y, and then ENTER if you’re using nano. You are now finished configuring the manager server, but you will still need to use this server to help configure your agent server.
Configuring the SNMP Agent Server
$ /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf

Inside, you will have to make a few changes. These will mainly be used to bootstrap your configuration so that you can manage it from your other server.

First, you need to change the agentAddress directive. Currently, it is set to only allow connections originating from the local computer. You’ll need to comment out the current line, and uncomment the line underneath, which allows all connections.

#  Listen for connections from the local system only
#agentAddress  udp:127.0.0.1:161
#  Listen for connections on all interfaces (both IPv4 *and* IPv6)
agentAddress udp:161,udp6:[::1]:161

The user you are creating will be called bootstrap and will be used as a template in which to create your first actual user. The SNMP packages do this through a process of cloning the user’s properties.

createUser bootstrap MD5 temp_password DES

Now that you have a new user specified, you can set up the level of access that this user will have. In this tutorial you will set this up for your bootstrap user, and also for the new user you will be creating, called demo.

rwuser bootstrap priv
rwuser demo priv

When you are finished making these changes, save and close the file.

vi /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf

#   Currently, the only supported master agent type for this token
#   is "agentx".
#
#   arguments: (on|yes|agentx|all|off|no)

master  agentx
# agentaddress: The IP address and port number that the agent will listen on.
#   By default the agent listens to any and all traffic from any
#   interface on the default SNMP port (161).  This allows you to
#   specify which address, interface, transport type and port(s) that you
#   want the agent to listen on.  Multiple definitions of this token
#   are concatenated together (using ':'s).
#   arguments: [transport:]port[@interface/address],...

#  Listen for connections from the local system only
#agentAddress  udp:127.0.0.1:161
#  Listen for connections on all interfaces (both IPv4 *and* IPv6)
agentAddress udp:161,udp6:[::1]:161

# SECTION: Access Control Setup
#
#   This section defines who is allowed to talk to your running
#   snmp agent.

#   arguments viewname included [oid]

#  system + hrSystem groups only

#   arguments:  community [default|hostname|network/bits] [oid | -V view]

# Read-only access to everyone to the systemonly view
rocommunity  Gokublack

# SNMPv3 doesn't use communities, but users with (optionally) an
# authentication and encryption string. This user needs to be created
# with what they can view with rouser/rwuser lines in this file.
#
createUser bootstrap MD5 temp_password DES
#
# This should be put into /var/lib/snmp/snmpd.conf
#
# rouser: a SNMPv3 read-only access username
#    arguments: username [noauth|auth|priv [OID | -V VIEW [CONTEXT]]]
rouser authPrivUser authpriv -V Madhu


To implement these changes, restart the snmpd service on your agent server:

#systemctl restart snmpd

The SNMP daemon will listen for connections on port :161. Configure UFW to allow connections from the manager server to this port:

#ufw allow from manager_server_ip_address to any port 161

PART-2										
Now, we need to install and configure the SNMP service on Ubuntu Linux.

On the Linux console, use the following commands to install the required packages.

# apt-get update
# apt-get install snmpd snmp

Now, you should find the location of the snmpd.conf file on your system.

After finding, you need to edit the snmpd.conf file.

# updatedb
# locate snmpd.conf
# vi /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf

Here is the original file, before our configuration and without the comments.

The Gokublack Community has read-only permission on the Ubuntu server.

The contact person responsible for this Linux was configured as Madhu.

The location of the equipment was configured as the IT Room of Universe 10.
